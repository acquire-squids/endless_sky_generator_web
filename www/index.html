        <h2>Template Plugin</h2>
        <p>
          A template plugin made for testing this web generator.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Rust code's kind of verbose, but that's okay.
          I made it for myself to use and I like using it, and that's all that matters.

        <h2>Full Map</h2>
        <p>
          A plugin that reveals every system and planet in the uploaded data folder when activated by a job available in any job board.
        </p>
        <p>
          This works by reading all `system` root nodes.  A system created by an event and defined nowhere else won't be included.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a system is hidden or shrouded, it may not remain revealed after takeoff, if it is even revealed at all.
