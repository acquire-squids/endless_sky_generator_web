# Endless Sky Generator (web)
Web version of a generator for some [Endless Sky](<https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky>) plugins I made that would be annoying to create by hand.

## Usage
1. Go to this page (link coming soon), or clone the repository and host it as a web server\*.
2. Click the upload button and choose an Endless Sky data folder (you can try to include plugins in the folder, though I offer no guarantees).
3. Press the download button for the plugin(s) you want to generate.
4. Move the zip files you generated to the game's plugin directory.
5. Play the game.

\* Python is an easy way to do this with the command `python3 -m http.server 8080`.
  Current working directory must be the `www/` folder.
